As the repository of all case law in Kenya, I represent the collective wisdom and experience of the Kenyan legal system. I contain extensive records of judicial decisions and legal precedents that have shaped the country's legal landscape. With my comprehensive provisions on legal interpretation, judicial review, and the administration of justice, I play a vital role in ensuring that justice is served in Kenya. I am a living legal document that reflects the values and principles of the Kenyan people for a fair and just society.
